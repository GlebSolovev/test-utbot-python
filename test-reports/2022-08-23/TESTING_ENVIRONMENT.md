# UTBot-Python Testing: Testing Environment

This file contains technical information about the version of the code being run and some environment settings such as
operating system and IDEA version.

## UTBot-Python parameters

The UTBot-Python code was taken
from [commit](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotJava/commit/190385c584165c98514b351c90a0602453a4607c) `190385c584165c98514b351c90a0602453a4607c`
of the `utbot-python-codegen` [branch](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotJava/tree/utbot-python-codegen): most recent
as of the evening of `08/23/2022`. Next, the product was launched using the Gradle `runIde` task.

The parameters in the test generation dialog window were set by default (timeouts, test framework): changed only the
output directory to a convenient one.

## Computer parameters

The computer has an operating system `Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS` with `x86_64` architecture.

Intellij IDEA version: `IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2 (Ultimate Edition)`. However, it is important to note that it was Intellij IDEA 
launched in `runIde` that directly participated in the testing.
